# Intro To React

These are daily projects that I completed throughout my Lambda School journey, most assigments should be completed and fully functional but might not have a lot of styling applied since I was focused on business logic.

## Cloning Projects

I recently combined all projects into this single repo to make my github profile easier to navigate.
Unfortunately Git does not allow to clone a subdirectory and forces you to clone the entire repository.
If you do decide to clone this here are the steps to run a specific project

- **git clone** https://github.com/prietop97/React-Training.git
- **cd Lambda \ School\ Daily\ Projects/03\ -\ Advanced\ React/[Project-Name]**
- **npm install**
- **npm start**

I do not mantain this projects due to time constrains but if a project does not run, feel free to email me **contact.predroprietp.dev**
